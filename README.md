# QueryGallery
EECS 4443 Final Project -
In modern society people take and store the majority of their photos with their smartphones and with increased usage comes a 
market demand for innovation; this innovation can be observed as photo apps have transformed from simple camera rolls to full 
scale apps with many features (editing tools and filters, facial recognition, location tagging, autonomous tagging, etc.). 
Despite all the innovations surrounding image storage on mobile devices, searching for specific images can still be cumbersome 
due to the large volume of images being stored and the fact that people do not usually organize their photos into albums.
Our solution for efficiently searching for images is through an application we will design called Query Gallery. This application
will allow users to take photos or upload images from the camera roll into the application. Upon upload the user will be prompted
to add tags to each of the images uploaded, thus allowing the images to be searchable through a search bar. Users will also have 
the ability to add, remove, and/or edit tags for existing photos. This application will also allow for the categorization of photos
into albums like most other photo catalog applications. Finally, using an autonomous tag recommendation system, Query Gallery will 
also be able to automatically tag images as well.
